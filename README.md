# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose of Analysis
The CEO of Pyber has tasked me with analyzing the company's ride-share data using python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. He wants me to provide insight on the differences between the three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The main areas that I look into through this project are, a general overview, rides, drivers, and fares in all three city types.

## Results
There are 4 different areas of analysis needed to complete this project. These are:



## Summary

Based on the results listed above, there are three different recommendations to address the disparities among the city types.

1, We should attract more drivers by showing that on average they can make more per ride compared to the other city types.

2,Similar to rural, suburban city types make up 26.3% of rides (Fig6) and 30.5% of fares, but only have 16.5% of drivers (Fig7). We should attract more drivers by showing they have the most consistent fares compared to the other city types (Fig3).

3,Oppisite to rural and suburban city types, urban city types only have 68.4% of rides (Fig6) and 62.7% of fares, but have 80.9% of drivers. We should attract more riders by showing that on average their fares are the lowest of any city type (Fig3).
