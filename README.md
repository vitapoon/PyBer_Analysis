# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose of Analysis
The CEO of Pyber has tasked me with analyzing the company's ride-share data using python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. He wants me to provide insight on the differences between the three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The main areas that I look into through this project are, a general overview, rides, drivers, and fares in all three city types.

## Results

According to the chart, we find out these facts:

1,Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.

2,Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.

3,Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.

4,Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares, they have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

5,Although the Urban cities command the most drivers, rides and fares, they have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

## Summary (Recommendations)

Based on the results listed above, there are three different recommendations to address the disparities among the city types.

1, Since rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares, they have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
We should attract more drivers by showing that on average they can make more per ride compared to the other city types.

2,Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
 We should attract more drivers by showing they have the most consistent fares compared to the other city types.

3,Oppisite to rural and suburban city types, the Urban cities command the most drivers, rides and fares, they have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver. Therefore we should attract more riders by showing that on average their fares are the lowest of any city type.
